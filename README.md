Hi there,

I have completed the assesment to showcase my technical ability as well as practices I believe are the best. There could always be some improvements but this is what I'm handing over :)

-----------------------------------

TO RUN THE APP:

please create a .env file in the root of the project and have your api key in there like this:

openWeatherAPIKey=<api_key>

eg:

openWeatherAPIKey=bb22334455667788991010

------------------------------------

Any questions, feedback or criticism would be highly appreciated!
